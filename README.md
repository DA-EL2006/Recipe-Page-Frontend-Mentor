Overview
The challenge

The challenge was to replicate the recipe page layout as closely as possible to the given design, focusing on spacing, typography, and color contrast. Users should be able to view a well-structured and readable recipe card that includes preparation time, ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.

My process

Built with

1. Semantic HTML5 markup

2. CSS custom properties

3. Flexbox for layout alignment

4. Desktop-first workflow

What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of structuring long-form content using semantic HTML. I also improved at controlling layout alignment with Flexbox and managing consistent padding and margins across sections.

A CSS snippet I’m proud of:

.Time-block {

  background-color: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);

  display: flex;
  
  flex-direction: column;
  
  justify-content: center;
  
  padding: 15px;
  
  border-radius: 17px;
}


This styling helped create a neat section highlight for the preparation time block, maintaining both readability and contrast.

Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus more on making designs responsive for smaller devices and refining my CSS structure with reusable utility classes. I’d also like to start using CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
